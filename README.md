1. Java JDK 1.6 or higher.

# GETTING STARTED

To compile and package the application use `mvn clean install`. The first time maven will download all required dependencies. This may take a while.

To start the application use `mvn jetty:run`. Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/` to see the welcome page.
